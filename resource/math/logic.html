				<h1> Logic </h1>
				<p> Logic is the study of argumentation or the laws of correct reasoning, as it provides the framework for evaluating the validity of arguments and the truth of it's statements. </p>
				<p> It's can be seperated into 2 difference catagories: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> <a> Natural logic </a>
					<p> Natural logic refers to the informal reasoning that occurs in everyday language and thought. It involves intuitive understanding and reasoning without the strict formalism of symbolic systems. </p>
					</li>
					<li> <a> Symbolic logic </a>
					<p> Symbolic logic involves the use of abstract symbols and systems to represent logical expressions and arguments. It provides a rigorous framework for analyzing reasoning. </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p> Argument form by a set of <a title = "Statement or proposition provides foundational support or the argument for the conclusion">premises</a> and a conclusion which may form a <a title = "Intentional attitude or belief which can be express">proposition</a>, the abstraction of an expression is a <a title = "Entity can only determined either true or false">truth-bearer</a>. The relationship between arguments or expressions can be described using logical connective. </p>
