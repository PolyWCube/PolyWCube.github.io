				<h1> Organic </h1>
				<p> Organic compound is the chemical compound contain carbon, except for <a title = "carbide">carbide</a>, <a>carbonate</a>, <a>carbon oxide</a> and <a>cyanide</a>. They typically have low melting point, boiling point and tend to be <a title = "The physcal property of matterial seemingly to repel from mass of water.">hydrophobic</a>. </p>
				
				<p> Their bonds mostly are <a>covalent bond</a>, follow with other least common bond like hydrogen bond, sulfur-sulfur bond. </p>
				<h2> Carbon Frame </h2>
				<p> At the atomic level, Carbon is a non-metalic element with the atomic number of six. It's also a tetravalent, which mean a carbon atom can form up to 4 single covalent bond with other atoms or molecules. There are 3 isotypes occur naturally of Carbon, the <sup>12</sup>C and <sup>13</sup>C are being stable, while the <sup>14</sup>C is a radionuclide, with the half-life of 5700 years. </p>
				<p> The carbon frame refer to the carbon linkage together as the skeletal structure. It's the backbone of all organic matter. Sometime refer as the C-base organic frame. </p>
				<h2> Hydrocarbon </h2>
				<p> The molecule contains only C-C and C-H bonds as it's only contains 2 element C (carbon) and H (hydrogen) </p> 
				<p> By changing the C-H bonds with other elements or functional groups, it create the derivative of hydrocarbon, which is extremely diverse and complex in both terms of structure and properties. </p>
