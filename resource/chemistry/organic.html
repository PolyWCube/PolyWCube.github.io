				<h1> Organic </h1>
				<p> <a href = "organic/compound.html">Organic compound</a> is the chemical compound contain carbon, except for <a title = "Anion 2- CaC">carbide</a>, <a title = "Anion 2- CO3">carbonate</a>, <a title = "COx">carbon oxide</a> and <a title = "Anion 1- CN">cyanide</a>. The elements compose of the organical molecule must contain C (carbon), and usually contain H (hydrogen), O (hydrogen), N (nitrogen), halogen group elements include F (flourine), Cl (clorine),... , S (sulfur), P (phosphorus),... . They typically have low melting point, boiling point and tend to be <a title = "The physcal property of matterial seemingly to repel from mass of water.">hydrophobic</a>. </p>
				<p> The chemical reaction of organical matter tend to be slow, reaction in many direction and create a mixture of products.  </p>
				<h2> Carbon Frame </h2>
				<p> At the atomic level, carbon is a non-metalic element with the atomic number of six. It's also a tetravalent, which mean a carbon atom can form up to 4 single covalent bond with other atoms or molecules. There are 3 isotypes occur naturally of carbon, the <sup>12</sup>C and <sup>13</sup>C are being stable, while the <sup>14</sup>C is a radionuclide with the half-life of 5700 years. </p>
				<p> The carbon frame refer to the carbon linkage together as the skeletal structure as it's the backbone of all organic matter. It's structure, the carbon frame formation and the covalent bond between the carbon molecules, creates some physical and chemical properties. Sometime, carbon frame refers as the C-base organic frame. </p>
				<h3> Hydrocarbon </h3>
				<p> The molecule contains only C-C and C-H bonds as it's only contains 2 element C (carbon) and H (hydrogen) </p>
				<p> They naturally appear as fossil fuel (petroleum, natural gas and coal, or their hydrocarbon derivatives and purified forms).  </p>
				<h3> Hydrocarbon derivative </h3>
				<p> More complex molecule with a hydrochain as the base, attached with other <a href = "organic/functional-group.html">functional group</a> </p> 
				<p> By changing the C-H bonds with other elements or functional groups which is called <a>substitutability</a>, it create the derivative of hydrocarbon, which is extremely diverse and complex in both terms of structure and properties. It's the reflection of carbon frame, include both physical and chemical properties. </p>
				<h2> Bond </h2>
				<p> Organic bonds mostly are <a>covalent bond</a>, follow with other less common bonds like hydrogen bond, sulfur-sulfur bond,... </p>
				<h2> Functional group </h2>
				<p> <a href = "organic/functional-group.html">Functional group</a> is the molecule or a group of molecule that can creates unique chemical properties. </p>
