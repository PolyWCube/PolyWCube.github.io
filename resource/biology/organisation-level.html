				<h1> Level Of Biological Organization </h1>
					<p> Levels of organization refer to the hierarchy of levels of organized physical matter that having characteristics of life, expanding from the microscopic scale of the atom, molecule, macromolecule, and cell to the global scale of the entire planet. Therefore, to emphasize and improve management, reductionism is an effective approach to dividing the complex system into simpler components. </p>
					<h2> The Hierarchy Of Organisation Level </h2>
						<p> The biosphere consists of multiple layer of organisation levels, arranges from the simplest to the most complex. They can be specify into two catagories: </p>
						<ul>
							<li> <a> Fundamental level </a>
							<p> The organisation level able to survive, thrive and develop independently, without relying on other organisation level. </p>
							<p> Include cell, body and ecological level <p></li>
							<li> <a> Intermediate level </a>
								<p> The organisation level unable to survive, thrive and develop, relying on the interaction of components of other organisation level in the system, but it's the essential component to build the higher level. </p>
								<p> Include every organisation level before cell, tissue, organ and organ system. </p></li>
						</ul>
						<h3> Biological Organisation Level </h3>
							<p> Atomic level (Pre-cellular level) </p>
							<ul>
								<li> <a> Atom </a>
									<p> The most basic and fundamental concept that make organic molecule and necessary environment for life to existed. </p>
								</li>
								<li> <a href = "organisation-level/molecule.html"> Molecule </a>
									<p> The special sequence and structure of atom create the dirverse, complex interaction enough to create the first living organism. </p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p> Cellular level </p>
							<ul>
								<li> <a id = "organelle"> Organelle </a>
									<p> The stable group of molecule have a specify function and structure. </p>
									<p> Also known as the subcellular subcomponent of a cell. </p>
								</li>
								<li> <a href = "organisation-level/cell.html"> Cell </a>
									<p> The base of every higher level of organisation, create their structural and functional units of them. </p>
									<p> The first level to consider a organism. </p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p> Muti-cellular level </p>
							<ul>
								<li> <a> Tissue </a>
									<p> The collection of cell with a shared, common and simular function and structure. </p>
									<p> Can be considered the fundamental structural unit of organ and organ system of an body. </p>
								</li>
								<li> <a> Organ </a>
									<p> The highly organised and specialized structure formed by a collection of multiple tissue with different functionalities. <p>
								</li>
								<li> <a> Organ System </a>
									<p> The system of multiple organs with different function but shared the same purpose. </p>
								</li>
								<li> <a> Body </a>
									<p> The physical form of muti-cellular organism, function and construct by mutiple organ system. </p>
								</li>
							</ul>

							<input type = "checkbox" id = "question" hidden></input>
							<label title = "Hint: A body is an organism but an organism not always a body." for = "question"> 
								What is the different between a body and a organism?
								<br>
								<p id = "answer"> An organism is a complete, individual living entity that can carry out all basic life processes and able to live independently, which could be neither unicellular (single-cellular) or multicellular. </p>
								<p id = "answer"> A body is specifically to the physical structure of a multicellular organism. </p>
								<br>
								<p id = "answer"> The term "organism" refers to the whole living entities. On other hand, the term "body" is the context focuses on the autonomy and physiology of a single physical structure of an organism. </p>
							</label>
							<br>
							<br>
							<hr>
							<p> Ecological level </p>
							<p> The level involve complex interaction between organism and also the environment, include the behaviour, physiology, evolutionary,..., and the environmental factors which are restrained life. Therefore, it's come up with the study of statistic and operation to deal with the size, concentration,... of different aspects of a ecological level. </p>
							<br>
							<ul>
								<li> <a> Population </a>
									<p> The group of individual organism of a same species within a region or space. </p>
								</li>
								<li> <a> Ecosystem </a>
								
								</li>
								<li> <a> Biosphere </a>
									<p> All life and environment that life can exist. </p>
								</li>
							</ul>
					<h2> The Concept Of Emergent </h2>
						<p> Emergent properties are a set of phenomena that integrate and arise from the complex interactions and arrangements of components created that organisation level as a system. Each organisation level is composed of the preceding level, which mean that the higher organisation level will inherited all the function and structure from the lower level. However, in this system, not only the function and structure of that components is inherited, also there are some new properties intergrated and arise from the interaction between components which is not belong to any of the components themself. For instance, as a cellular level, cell only be able to "communicate" using chemical or physical signal, contract and other function, they can form an organ called larynx, which is an essential organ enable human to create complex sound and speak by constricted air flow and create pressure needed for speech production. </p>
						<p> This serve a purpose of survivability, the evident for adaptation and evolution as the more complex life is, the the more likely they are able to survive, adapt, passing their characteristic to their next generation and evolute. </p>
