				<h1> Organism Classification </h1>
					<p> The sciencific name classification of organism base on it's shared characteristic and structure. Organisms are grouped into distincted catagories, rank and intergrated to form a more includesive group of higher rank which creating a hierarchy reflect the relation or differentiateion between organisms. For instance, <a title = "" href = "">Homo Sapien</a> is the classification name of the mankind or the modern human, is the last suriving species of genus Homo, of Mammal domain. </p>
					<h2> Hierarchy Of Organism Classification </h2>
						<h3> Characteristic Classification </h3>
							<p> The classification of organism is bases on these characteristic: </p>
							<ul>
								<li> <a> Structure </a> </li>
								<li> <a> Vital Process </a> </li>
								<li> <a> Behaviour </a> </li>
								<li> <a> Ecologic </a> </li>
								<li> <a> Geographic </a> </li>
							</ul>
						<h3> Domain (Superkingdom) </h3>
							<p>  </p>
							<ul>
								<li> <a> Archaea </a> </li>
								<li> <a> Bacteria </a> </li>
								<li> <a href = "organism-classification/eukarya.html"> Eukarya </a> </li>
							</ul>
						<h3> Kingdom </h3>
							<p id = "archaea"> Prokaryotic, unicellular extremophile, simular to bacteria, but with significant biochemical differences. Their cellular structure contain ether-linked lipid to live and may thrive in <a href = "environment.html#extreme-environment" title = "The harsh and extreme environment such as deep sea vent, high salt concentrations, radiate,...">extreme environment</a>. </p>
							<p id = "bacteria"> Prokaryotic, typically unicellular, althought some can form multicellular structures. Their cell membrane primary composed of peptidoglycan. Diverse metabolic pathways, allow them to inhabit various environments. </p>
							<p id = "eukarya"> Eukaryotic, can be unicellular and multicellular, tend to create a much more complex structure and function. </p>
							<ul>
								<li> <a> Animalia </a> </li>
								<li> <a> Plantae </a> </li>
								<li> <a> Fungi </a> </li>
								<li> <a> Protista </a> </li>
