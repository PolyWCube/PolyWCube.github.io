						<li> <a href = "genetic-mechanism/gene-expression.html"> Gene Expression </a>
							<p> The biological process of genetic information from gene create a functional product which affect a phenotype of organism. In most case, gene expression follow the path of DNA - RNA - protein - phenotype. </p>

						<li> <a href = "genetic-mechanism/gene-regulation.html"> Gene Regulation </a>
							<p> The mechanism allows organisms to save and use energys and resources more efficient within their life cycles, making them more capable for life. </p>

							<p> The correlationship between the environment and genetic information which makes organisms become more responsive and adaptive to extracellular environment. </p>
