				<h1> Cell </h1>
					<p> Cells are the basic structural and functional units of every higher organisation. They are the first organsation level consider an organism as the contain all the characteristic of life. For instance, <a title = "Short for Escherichia Coli, is a gram-negative, facultative, anaerobiv, rod-shaped and coliform baterium that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms." href = "">E.coli</a> is a unicellular organism of the bacteria domain, can be used in medical production as it has the rapid cell cycle of 20 minute. </p>
					<h2> Basic Structure </h2>
						<p> All cells have some certain shared basic structure as every cells consists of cytoplasm contains genetic structure and organelle enclosed within a membrane. These are the most fundamental and basic structural that create functional unit suitable for life to exist and thrive. </p>
						<h3> Cell Membrane (Cytoplasmic Membrane) </h3>
							<p> The biological membrane separates and protects the interior of a cell from the extracellular environment compose of notably lipids and proteins, which include the two layers of phospholipid (lipid bilayer) with cholesterols interspersed between them, the <a title = "The structure formed when ologosaccharide chain attached to amino acid side-chains in the glycosylation">glycoprotein</a>, glycosaccharide and functional protein.</p>
						<h3> Cytoplasm (Cytosol) </h3>
							<p> The semifluid subtance where all the <a>vital processes</a> occur and <a href = "../organisation-level.html#organelle">subcellular component</a> suspended. </p>
					<p> They can be divided into two distinct types: </p>
					<ul>
						<li> <a> Prokaryote </a>
