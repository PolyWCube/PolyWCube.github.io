				<h1> Vital Process </h1>
					<p> The essential processes for an organism to live and that shape its capacities for interacting with its environment. These processes are made of many chemical reactions or other events that are involved in the persistence and transformation of life forms. </p>
					<p> Regulation of biological processes occurs when any process is modulated in its frequency, rate or extent. Biological processes are regulated by many means; examples include the control of gene expression, protein modification or interaction with a protein or substrate molecule. </p>
					<ul>
						<li> <a> Metabolism </a>
							<p> The transformation of energy by converting chemicals and energy into cellular components and decomposing organic matter. </p>
						</li>
						<li> <a> Homeostasis </a>
							<p> Regulation of the internal environment to maintain a stable state. </p>
						</li>
						<li> <a> Differentiation </a>
							<p> The process of manipulating and changing of a group of organisation levels is specialized into a specific function or structure. </p>
						</li>
						<li> <a> Metamorphosis </a>
							<p> The physical transformation process of the organism's body. </p>
