				<h1> Heredity (Inheritance) </h1>
					<p> The passing on of traits from parents to their offspring. It could be through asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction, the offspring cells or organisms acquire the genetic information from their parents. </p>
					<h2> Gene </h2>
						<p> The sequence of nucleotides in DNA that can be used to pass in the genetic information create a functional product, which could be either a RNA or protein, in the process of synthesis of functional product from gene, which called gene expression, RNA first copy DNA genetic infomation. RNA can directly functional or become the intermediate template for the synthesis of protein. </p>
						<h3> Genenome </h3>
							<p> The complete set of genes within an genome. </p>
						<h3> Genenotype </h3>
							<p> The variants of a particular individual gene or an allele of a gene. </p>
					<h2> Trait </h2>
						<p> Most trait occur under the combinated influence of <a title = "The set of multiple, diffent gene">polygene</a> and gene-environment interaction. </p>
						<h3> Phenotype </h3>
							<p> The obserrvable traits of the structure or behaviour of a organism, is formed by the gene expression of a genotype of a trait. </p>
					<h2> Chromosome </h2>
						<p> The structure form from a DNA and protein in multiple structural levels. </p>
					<h2> The Relationship Between Gene And The Environment </h2>
						<p> The genome is a set of genes that contains the instruction to create a functional product during the gene expression which later interacts and integrates, creating traits of a functional organism. Conversely, the environment gives the ingredients and conditions for normal gene expression. Additionally, the environment also plays a role in regulating the cell's inner system. </p>
					<h2> Mendelian Inheritance </h2>
						<h3> Law Of Dominance And Uniformity </h3>
						<h3> Law Of Segregation </h3>
						<h3> Law Of Independent Assortment </h3>
