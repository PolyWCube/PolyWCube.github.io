				<h1> DNA (Deoxyribosenucleotide Acid) </h1>
					<p> The polymer of one or multiple polynucleotide chains (DNA strand) coil in clockwise direction form a helix structure. The DNA strand's monomeric units is nucleotides. Each nucleotides composed of a nitrogenous nucleobase, a deoxyribose sugar and a phosphate group. Between nucleotides are special covalent bond called phosphodiester. </p>
					<br>
					<p> Here is some alternative forms of DNA: </p>
					<p> Depend on strand types: </p>
					<ul>
						<li> <a title = "Single-strand DNA" id = "ssDNA"> ssDNA </a>
							<p> The genetic material of certain viruses and temporary occur during specific biological process(DNA replication, transcription,...). Less stable compare to dsDNA due to the absence of hydrogen bonds, make it vulnerable to hydrolysis and degradation. </p>
						</li>
						<li> <a title = "Double-strand DNA"> dsDNA </a>
							<p> The most common form of DNA, the primary genetic material of almost any organism and virus. More stable as it has various repair mechanisms to correct and maintain genetic integirity and hydrogen bonds. </p>
						</li>
						<li> <a title = "Triple-strand or H-DNA"> tsDNA </a>
							<p> This structure rarely encountered because the formation of it often requires certain conditions(high salt concentration, specific pH level,...). Potential to provide insights into genetic regulation and repair mechanism. </p>
						</li>
						<li> <a title = "G-Quadruplex DNA"> G4-DNA </a>
							<p> On progress </p>
						</li>
						<li> <a> Hybrid DNA </a>
							<p> The combination of different types of DNA and other nucleic acid (RNA, DNA from different source,...). Temporary occur under some biological processes(repair mechanism, regulation, gene expression,...) </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h2> Helix Geometry </h2>
						<p> There are at least three DNA conformations (A-DNA, B-DNA and Z-DNA) are believed to be found in nature during vital processes of a biological system, the others (C-DNA, E-DNA, S-DNA,...) which most of them have been created syntherically, has been described it's function, structure and properties. They're all have DNA structure but with slightly or significantly differentiation between their geometrys and dimensions. Additionally, B-DNA is also believed to predominate in cells, which lead to most of the study about DNA refers to it. </p>
						<h3> B-DNA </h3>
							<p> The DNA have the helixcal structure with 2.37 nm. and extended 3.4 nm per 10 <a>pb</a> </p>
