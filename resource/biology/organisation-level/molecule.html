				<h1> Molecule </h1>
				<p> Biological molecules or biomolecules are those <a href = "../../chemistry/organic.html">organic molecules</a> with specific and special funtions and structures that allow life exist. In short, these molecules are composed of a cacbon frames as the skeletal structure with the function group attached on which could create complex interactions and behaviours. Additionally, it's functions and properties highly diverse as it can become a <a title = "The group of identical molecular formular with the same numbers and types of element compose itself.">isomer</a>. </p>
				<p> There are 4 major biomolecules: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> <a href = "molecule/macromolecule/sacharide.html"> Saccharide </a>
					<p> Also known as carbohydrate or glucide are the crucial micromolecule as it serves as the main energy source and structural component of organism. </p>
					</li>
					<li> <a href = "molecule/macromolecule/protein.html"> Protein </a>
					<p> It is extremely dirverse, leading to a variety of function, include enzyme, structural component, transporter, antibodies, hormone,... </p>
					</li>
					<li> <a href = "molecule/lipid.html"> Lipid </a>
					<p> The main enery storage and participate on structurize cell membrain and signaling molecule. </p>
					</li>
					<li> <a href = "molecule/macromolecule/nucleic-acid.html"> Nucleic Acid </a>
					<p> The essential component stores and transmits genetic code throught out sequence and structure for expression, adaption and evolution. </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p> 3 of them (sacharide, nucleic acid and protein) are consider <a href = "molecule/macromolecule.html" title = "The large and complex molecule compose of large sub-units">macromolecule</a>. </p>
				<p> Understanding their composition, structure, and functions is fundamental to the study of biology and biochemistry. </p>
